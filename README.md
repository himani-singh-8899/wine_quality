The task here is to predict the quality of red wine on a scale of 0â€“10 given a set of features as inputs. I have solved this problem using k nearest neighbors.
Input variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.
